<h1>Developer productivity</h1>

<p>Majoring developer productivity is one of the dounting task for me. Not being as a manager but also as a developer.
Someitme I spend whole day thinking about task and not making any progress. Sometime I just open the editior and keep writing it, debugging it, solvinging it all at the same time.
I am not even sure how to major my productivity. If task is done I feel happy and if it is not done irrespective of how much work i have put, it keep bothering me.
Whenever someone ask me about a productivitiy  of developers like how to major it, how to improve it etc etc I just go blank and feel clueless.</p>

<p>Before major it or improve it, I think we what we should focus on why we want evaluate it.
I think we really want to evaluate it so that we can compare and them improve.</p>

<p>Current matrics which most of the system trying to evaluates are like number of commits, no of PR, no of PR reviews, code coverage, esapce defects, valocity  etc. I fount it all are good and bad at the same time. Its dependent on how they use it.
If they use it as dicussion and how we can improve it they all provide some value. If they use to reward or punish, all can be manupulate.</p>

<p>Another thing which I found facinating is team performance.
Now some of the above can be use to evaluate the team performance as well like velocity, escape defect etc.
Again if they are all for the dicussion and improvement they are great but the momeont they are used to evaluate the team perofrmace just by looking at mumbers, pupiple will improve the numbers without adding any value.</p>

<p>Being a manager the tricky part is to tell leadership not to use these items to compare the team but transfer learning from one team to another team.</p>

<p>One of the key item which improve the overall team productivity is automation and fast automation which</p>

<p>Effectiveness and outcome
Team vs individual
Developer experience
Pull request throughtout</p>

<p>Majoring Sleep is also a tricky part. Whever I tried with devices like MI Band, I got confuesed. Sometime it shows, I sleep well, but i don&rsquo;t feel like it. Sometime I feel OK but device say sometime else and now I feel tense.</p>
